Implementing auto-vectorization hints for par_unseq and unseq versions of HPX parallel algorithms,A Kishore Kumar,https://github.com/akcube/hpx,"Srinivas Yadav, Nikunj Gupta",Ste||ar group,"c++, openmp, compilers","high performance computing, SIMD, Auto-Vectorization","C++ 17 and 20 released the par_unseq and unseq execution models which give guarantees to functions which specialize on them that data access functions can be interleaved even between iterations of one thread. This means that these functions are vectorization safe and can thus gain massive boosts in performance by compiler auto-vectorization. Compilers however are conservative and auto-vectorize loops only when they are sure that vectorized versions give the same result as their scalar counterparts and that vectorization will actually end up being profitable. GCC, Clang, MSVC, ICC all rely on different optimization passes in their backend and are all capable of auto-vectorizing certain loop patterns but not all. The goal of this project is to analyze compiler codegen response to different hints and implement a version of the par_unseq and unseq execution policies in HPX that makes use of these guarantees to provide compilers with as many hints as possible to encourage auto-vectorization.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/Xtj2bzL7

A taxonomy in Open Food Facts is a raw text file containing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each leaf node has one or more parent nodes. It is mainly used for classification and translation of various food products within the database. Hence, taxonomies are at the heart of data structures in the Open Food Facts database and must be maintained properly. This project provides an User-Friendly interface developed for editing taxonomies with ease. This tool is helpful for contributors to visualize a node's translations, properties, parents and children in a single page. The editor allows users to perform CRUD operations on the taxonomy and on the nodes present. A fast search mechanism for finding nodes within the taxonomy has also been implemented successfully.

GSoC Project Proposal for Flashrom,Aarya,https://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2022/09/08/gsoc-optimize-erase-function-selection-wrap-up/,"Thomas Heijligen, Simon_B",Flashrom,"c, x86, bios, rom, spi, flash",Optimize Erase-Function Selection,"The write operation in flash can only change bits in a specific way and the erase operation changes all the bits of a block to 1s. So to modify any bit the whole block needs to be copied to another memory, erased on the flash, and then copied again from the other memory with the change. Due to this “erase overhead” write operations may require copying a lot of data to modify a small amount. Most flash chips support multiple erase-block sizes and flashrom keeps a list of these sizes and ranges for all supported flash chips. Currently, flashrom tries these functions one by one and uses the same function until the operation is completed or an error occurs. Usually, the first function works correctly but this function erases the smallest erase-block so flashrom would have to use it multiple times to complete the erase operation on a large region, which could have been done more efficiently using functions using larger erase-blocks, thus resulting in a transaction overhead. If a large erase-block size to erase a small region is chosen it would result in a larger erase overhead. So the erase-block size should be picked according to the size of the region left to be erased. Also checking in advance to tell if the programmer supports the given erase function and then sorting the supported functions in order of the erase-block sizes can further help the function selection.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/upN80V5b

"[KerasNLP] Adding Metrics, Decoding Strategies, Model Encoder Blocks and Data Augmentation APIs",Abheesht Sharma,https://befitting-pajama-3af.notion.site/Summer-of-22-My-Time-with-KerasNLP-db8d9403fcc34e739a26922c10988c71,Luke Wood,TensorFlow,"python, tensorflow, keras","machine learning, computational linguistics, natural language processing, deep learning","KerasNLP is a library for building NLP building blocks such as model layers, metrics, tokenizers, text processing/augmentation techniques, etc. I have contributed a few of these modules myself, and would like to contribute more such modules during GSoC. Firstly, I would like to contribute NLP-specific metrics. Here, I plan to implement metrics which are not present in Keras, and which are generally used for NLP tasks. Most of these metrics will be implemented as live training metrics, i.e., they can be input to `model.compile` and computed during training. Hence, the implementation should be ""in graph mode"". The metrics I wish to implement are: BLEU Score, Word Error Rate [WER], Character Error Rate [CER], CHRF, CHRF++ and BLEURT. Secondly, I wish to add functions for decoding strategies. Text Generation is an important problem in NLP. It encompasses tasks like summarisation, machine translation, story generation, etc. During inference, we need to sequentially decode the output of the encoder-decoder model. This is where these utility functions will help users. I plan to implement popular decoding strategies like Random Sampling, Greedy Sampling, Beam Search, top-k Sampling and top-p (nucleus) Sampling. I also want to add model encoder layers. KerasNLP does not aim to build complete models; it aims to build ""building blocks"" from which models can be built. Keeping this in mind, some encoder layers which I aim to implement are (these encoder layers can then be stacked up to form the complete model): Reformer and ConvBERT (or gMLP) encoder blocks. Text augmentation means perturbing the samples in the original dataset to increase the size of the training set. This is where native text augmentation layers can be immensely useful. Backtranslation and Contextual Word Augmentation are methods which I will implement. The above modules are explained in details in the proposal document.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/2zKr5UPe

It offers near native performance in a browser and is meant to not be a hand written language but to be the compilation target of source languages like C, C++, Rust etc. It provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so. It, being a new language , does not enjoy wide support across platforms. The prospect of having a unified interface for web developers has long been elusive. It has the potential to provide the basis on which many apps can be built and deployed for a huge range of devices from IoT devices to fully fledged servers. But to enable developers to use it we need a WASI runtime ecosystem to support them. WasmEdge is one such project that aims to bring WebAssembly to the edge. To provide a unified interface accross multiple platforms, a interface between WasmEdge and the host operating system has to be built. This interface is specific to the platform on which the runtime is deployed and has to be built individually and specifically for each platform bearing in mind the features available. The native API provided by the OS should be used to implement many of the common operations like file manipulation, IO etc. These 'host functions' are crucial for the project to succeed and have been defined in WASI - the Web Assembly System Interface which is a modular collection of standardised APIs Currently, host specific functions have not been implemented in WasmEdge, for the windows platform.

The current bitmap implementation has several problems. These are - 1) Decompression of bitmaps is slow with EWAH. To know if an object is related to a particular commit, we have to decompress the whole thing. 2. Loading a `.bitmap` file can be slow for large bitmaps. This is because we need to read the file sequentially in order to discover the offset of each bitmap within the file. 3. Regenerating bitmaps can take a long time. 4. If we solve the above points, we would think of other aspects like rethinking how we select which commit receives bitmaps etc. Now there are multiple ways to solve these problems. Point to point solution is given below - 1. There are better and more modern techniques than EWAH for compressing. Roaring+run bitmap can be used as an alternative to EWAH. So that, we can optimize the performance of compressing/decompression. I will also write performance tests to verify that. One possible approach to problem no. 3, is to add a new mode that only adds new bitmaps for commits introduced between successive bitmap generations. To solve problem no. 2, we can create a `table of contents for these bitmaps. Taylor (mentor) has already initiated some work on it.

A quick and intuitive view of the world map in relation to population makes it easy for viewers to co-relate the effect and the relative measure's gravity. OWID uses a range of choropleth maps, but size-scaled maps have downsides, primarily because human visual perception associates areas with importance. Furthermore, readily available alternatives use mosaic cartograms, which distort the shape of countries. To solve this problem, in a sentence, the primary objective is to plot a visually conclusive world map by illustrating territories/countries using a method for trading off shape and area. The basic idea of the solution is to distort the size-scaled world map while preserving the shape of countries to generate a population-scaled world map. Furthermore, a manually generated population-scaled world map acts as the reference for optimizing the cost function for better results.

Adding Native Support for Text Data Augmentation in KerasNLP alongside Tutorials,Aflah,https://aflah02.github.io/GSOC_Report/,Luke Wood,TensorFlow,"python, tensorflow, KerasNLP","nlp, Data Augmentation","Data Scarcity is a Huge and Evergrowing Problem as new tasks and problems are tackled. Sometimes collecting substantial amount of data is almost impossible/ extremely expensive as well incases of Low Resource Languages etc. hence Deep Learning Practitioners have moved to Data Augmentation Techniques to create synthetic data from real data. In Computer Vision the parallels are very clear for instance zooming in on an image or rotating an image retains labels in most cases however in Language wrong modifications can lead to mislabeling of data pretty quickly and hence it's much more trickier to perform Data Augmentation in these cases. Through my proposal I would like to add 10 Data Augmentation Techniques most of which are Rule Based but have been used extensively in NLP literature to achieve substantial improvements. Having these Techniques as layers would make it convenient for users to add these techniques to their workflow and push models into training. Tweaking augmentations would also be less of a hassle as currently most Data Augmentation libraries don't offer seamless integration with models without writing custom code. \ The 10 Techniques I plan to implement are Synonym Replacement, Random Deletion, Random Swaps, Random Insertion, Stop Word Dropout, Character Level Swap, Keyboard Typo, SentenceShuffle, Remove Duplicate Sentences and Back Translation All of these techniques have been used in Heavily Cited Works making them the perfect candidates to add to the list. By the end of the GSOC tenure my goal is to have these techniques fully implemented as layers with accompanying tutorials to get started with them for new users to quickly add these to their workflows once the library has a formal release.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/txBeI4c8

As the research community grows, it gets harder to find relevant reviewers. This project aims to use the power of Natural Language Processing to develop an automatic pipeline for paper-reviewer assignments to optimize the reviewer matching process. We will build a cloud database of reviewers, a web application with log-in based on ReactJS that allows editors to store info about the reviewers, a Python program that parses reviewers from scientific journals, and an API that uses NLP to recommend reviewers based on the abstracts. All together, this project will expedite the reviewer matching process and reduce potential bias during reviewer assignment.

Positive Semi-definite Procrustes (PSDP) Problem,Alapan Chaudhuri (Arjo),https://banrovegrie.github.io/files/GSOC.pdf,legend,Open Chemistry,"python, numpy, Scipy","Numerical Analysis, Mathematical Optimization, Procrustes","Procrustes (a part of Theochem by QC-Devs) is a library for finding the optimal transformation that makes two matrices as close as possible to each other. The main idea of this project is to solve and implement the problem of finding this optimal transformation when it is constrained to be a positive semi-definite matrix. PSDP and its analog problems (like the nearest correlation matrix problem) have applications in molecular alignment, structure analysis, quantitative finance and machine learning. As a part of the project, the intended contributions are two-fold. Firstly, the aim is to extend the Procrustes library to include algorithms solving PSDP as a new class of Procrustes problems along with benchmarking the implementations. Secondly, the plan is to introduce additional extensions to the library involving solutions to the PSDP problem where the trace, diagonal elements, or other linear constraints over the transformation (i.e., the matrix) are imposed.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/HPZ1bacs

However, as highlighted by a recent study, the research on compiler testing has critically neglected the front-end component of compilers, leaving unfound bugs in the type checking procedure of compilers. More specifically, this could lead to the compilers of statically-typed languages, which utilize features such as type inference, both accepting erroneous programs and rejecting correct ones. Hephaestus is a tool designed to test the compilers of three languages, namely Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It has already successfully detected over 150 bugs in the compilers of these languages. I propose a way to extend Hephaestus for it to be able to successfully test and detect bugs in the compiler of TypeScript. This can be a great contribution to the user-base and community of TypeScript, a language that has risen in popularity and usage in the past years. Hephaestus detects bugs by: 1. generating semantically-valid programs that (a) utilize parametric polymorphism and (b) are abstract 2. generating these programs in an intermediate representation (IR), an OOP language that supports parametric polymorphism and type inference 3. using translators to convert the abstract IR program to the desired language.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/sSPlO4FN

Why is this a problem? As of now, we have to deal with authenticating each user for every application. Integrating an IAM with Payment-Hub will help balance security with efficiency, giving customers quick access to their finances while barring anyone else. As other digital technologies become increasingly agile, customers become more accustomed to speed, making these considerations more critical. Also, with the rise in remote access to the system, we must have a secure way to authenticate and authorize users. If every employee had access to all data, one breached account could spell disaster for an entire Financial Organization. IAM brings in the segmentation and privilege restriction aspects which is necessary as remote access expands. The agility benefits of segmentation and digital identities make IAM the ideal solution. Goal: Integrating an Identity and Access Management system (Anubis/Keycloak) to Payment-Hub. Project Impact: Currently, there is no Identity manager in Payment-Hub and users are authenticated only using basic auth. Integrating an IAM System(Keycloak) with Payment Hub will have the following major impacts: - Single Sign-On capability: There will be unique sign-on credentials for access to any system, network or service. Keycloak can be used to integrate this. - Multi-Factor Authentication: It will involve two or more forms of login credentials for information access. - Privileged Access Management: We would be able to bound users to a set of privileges/access. This will provide a secure way to monitor access control with more visibility. - Securing APIs: IAM system will also help secure APIs and API Keys.

This software, developed over the past decade by hundreds of physicists, is constantly evolving to optimize the algorithms for better physics performance and resource efficiency. Given the size, diversity and dynamic nature of the development team, quality assurance of the software is a big challenge. Belle II Software has had several monitoring schemes implemented so far, along with a high-level validation tool. This tool runs on existing large datasets producing distribution plots of quantities relevant for physics analyses and displaying the results on a webpage. This project aims to improve this validation tool. Bookkeeping of known issues detected by the tool, along with improved logging and integration with the issue tracking system can help fast track root cause analyses. The plots generated can also display more relevant information, and point toward the datasets used to encourage the reuse of common artefacts. The plan is to enhance the user experience of the Belle II software validation tool and make workflows more efficient with appropriate technical solutions. We will start with integrating the issue tracking system with the validation tool, to better track the history of degradations. The plotting module will be overhauled to include relevant software information, as well as hyperlinks to make them self-sufficient. Enhancements to the logging module to have better logs attached directly to the issues from the validation tool to fast track issue debugging. The common artefacts will be pooled together in a manner allowing for easy reference from plots, logs and issues and also to prevent regeneration overheads.

Make it easier for contributors to choose pictures for upload on the Commons Android app,Ayan Sarkar,https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/5035,"Aditya Srivastav, Nicolas Raoul",Wikimedia Foundation,"android, java, kotlin, sql","database, ui, ux","1. At the bottom of the picker, there will be two buttons ""Upload"" to start the Upload Wizard with the selected pictures (replacing the already implemented ✔️ button currently available at the top-right) and ""Mark as not for upload"" to mark these pictures with a 🚫 overlay icon (and grey them out). For instance, family pictures are not meant to be uploaded to Commons. This state will be remembered even after restarting the app. Tapping ""Not for upload"" when all selected pictures are already marked as ""Not for upload"" has the opposite effect, a bit like pressing ""Italic"" twice in a text editor makes the selected text in Italic then normal. 2. Switch to hide/unhide pictures that are either marked as ""Not for upload"" or have been uploaded already. Hiding them allows the contributor to more easily spot pictures they might want to upload. 3. Currently, when selecting 3 pictures, they are numbered ""1"", ""2"", ""3"". Instead, please make all numbers always show the number of selected pictures, for instance, if 3 pictures are selected, they should all have the number ""3"", and be uploaded in the same order as their thumbnails are shown. 4. Add a fast scrollbar (ideally a Bubble scroll showing the date at which the pictures shown were taken). 5.

Model Order Reduction in Julia SciML,Bowen Zhu,https://github.com/SciML/ModelOrderReduction.jl,"Chris Rackauckas, Flemming Holtorf",NumFOCUS,julia,Model Order Reduction,"For simulating a system that contains many variables and/or equations, traditionally computational engineers tend to focus on utilizing an appropriate method with realistic time and space complexity. The technique of model order reduction (MOR), however, aims at approximating the original model with reduced number of variables and/or equations and still keeping sufficient accuracy. MOR is especially useful in various industries, for example thermal-fluids engineering, micro-electro-mechanical systems and control, where large-scale simulations have to be performed. The methods of model order reduction can be classified into several classes including proper orthogonal decomposition, reduced basis, balanced truncation, etc. Several MOR libraries have been well developed in MATLAB and Python. For instance, pyMOR is a Python library that relies on the application of reduced basis methods to parameterized partial differential equations. MATLAB's model reducer supports pole-zero simplification, balanced truncation mode selection methods and so on. In Julia, the main package that enables symbolic modeling is ModelingToolkit.jl, whose key features consist of automatic transformation and structural simplification, but it needs further works on fast ML approximate transformations.

However, Transitland data is no longer compatible with Valhalla due to their internal updates. To bring back transit routing support to Valhalla and make it less reliant on third-party software, it can receive transit data from GTFS directly. There are downsides of simply updating the code for Transitland: (a) it is dependent on OpenstreetMap, making Valhalla heavier, while GTFS can be independent, (b) Valhalla is still vulnerable to future changes in Transitland code that may break the code. Therefore, this proposal is for an independent integration of transit data from RAW GTFS, rather than being dependent on a third-party platform.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ZLkTUrMt

However, there are also hints that this UI requires some additional work before the release and that this proposal could assist with. VLC on macOS, for example, does not quite look like other macOS applications yet, though it’s obvious that this is an objective of the Mac team. Navigation does not work the same way as other AppKit applications and is structured in an unconventional manner. Additionally, there are visual divergences from the Apple HIG. The proposal contains visual examples of this. This proposal therefore seeks to assist in the redesign of the macOS UI for VLC by altering the aspects of the current implementation that clash with established human interface guidelines in macOS applications. Specifically, this proposal suggests: 1. A redesign of the playlist to resemble collapsible sidebars used in other macOS applications (such as the Music app’s playlist sidebar) 2. Changes to navigation elements within main views, such as the aforementioned double tab bar 3. Attention to detail and ensuring visual polish (correct alignment of elements, proper use of separators and view coloration to distinguish between parts of the app Lastly, the current nightly version of the VLC player lacks the ability to control playback, volume, etc. from the video reproduction window.

For years users have been frustrated by Haskell's conspicuous lack of support for namespacing features common in other languages. Haskell provides a limited form of namespacing with qualified imports, but using it to namespace field selectors tends to require hacky file structures. Fortunately, Haskell now provides `DuplicateRecordFields`, and GHC 9.2 introduced the `OverloadedRecordDot` language extension. These together provide a cleaner and more ergonomic interface for working with record types, a step towards better namespace support in Haskell. HLS already supports record dot-syntax to a small extent. For example, in the line `y = x.a`, type information is available when hovering over `y` or `x`. To unlock the full potential of this syntax though, HLS users should be able to ""dot into"" the record to see its fields, enabling IDE-driven API exploration.

An active health check provided by Envoy removes unhealthy instances immediately and then joins the service route when the instance is healthy again. However, the readinessProbe implementation provided by Dubbo does not apply to mesh.

Fortunately, modern hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs) can improve the computational efficiency of large vector and matrix operations. While this hardware doesn't greatly benefit Cholesky decompositions, an approach called ""blackbox matrix multiplication"" (BBMM) has been developed for exact inference of Gaussian processes. BBMM efficiently utilise the benefits of GPUs, leading to quadratic asymptotic time complexity. This project aims to replace Cholesky decompositions required for inference of Gaussian processes with BBMM and similar methods, leading to massive improvements in computational efficiency for Gaussian process inference in PyMC.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/Q25GbRRz

The advantage of multi-output GPs is its capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have the same source of uncertainty from inputs. This provides a useful and practical approach for various applications in different fields. The creation of new sampling methods and the advance in computing power have paved the way for the development of Bayesian models. Different software frameworks have been built to facilitate this probabilistic programming approach. Among those, PyMC is one of the most popular frameworks with a large and strong community. PyMC provides friendly interfaces that allow users in academics and industries to perform both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian data analysis. For Bayesian nonparametric models, the Gaussian process module in PyMC supports various mean and kernel classes. However, the current GP implementations in PyMC are limited to single output. This project aims to add support for multi-output GPs in PyMC.

Hence, it is necessary to have a system in place to protect our systems from such risks. The risk of malicious attacks is especially higher when browsing the internet. Thus, there is a need for an external system to intervene and block any unauthorized requests to the web server. A web application firewall(WAF) does just that. Modsecurity follows the OWASP Core Rule Set(CRS) rules to detect any vulnerabilities. This helps make web browsing more secure. The CRS has different Paranoia Levels which represent different security levels. At higher paranoia levels, the system has a stricter set of rules to block malicious activities. However, at such high paranoia levels, many genuine requests also get blocked as they resemble malicious activities. These are known as false positives. Such a large number of false positive detections hinders the user experience and as a result, they may stop using CRS and compromise security. Hence, it is important to reduce the number of false positive detections. As the data isn’t labeled, using an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm is the best possible way to achieve this. With the existing proposal by Floriane Gilliéron as a basis, I would work on an unsupervised learning algorithm for the machine learning plugin and aim to get it integrated as an official plugin.

Designed with GHC-the-program as the sole consumer in mind, it is very difficult for newer tooling to reuse its components. These problems extend to the inclusion of new backends such that implementations for various target platforms forked GHC frequently. The first step to improving the current design is the isolation of the different components and separation the codebase in layers for different purposes, described in the classic book ""Domain Driven Design"". This is already partly done, and in this project I join the existing effort by working on the next remaining subsystem: GHC's Core pipeline. In order to achieve my goal, I will proceed by using an incremental bottom-up approach: Starting at the bottom of the module hierarchy, I will push references to upper layers module-by-module up in the callstack until they are completely removed from each component. For the entry points of each in-scope component, I will then provide component-specific configuration types and corresponding initialization functions. The in-scope components are specific configurable tasks of the optimizer, and the optimizer as a whole. With this work completed, there will be significantly less references to the ubiquitous global states used throughout the whole compiler, namely the DynFlags and the HscEnv type, and significantly fewer imports of modules from upper layers, e.g. the driver.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/WWgHBTde

The analyzer's transfer functions need to be taught about the new AST nodes, BindingDecl and DecompositionDecl, to work correctly in all three interpretations described by the Standard. Incomplete support for structured bindings is a common source of false positives in the uninitialized variable checker on modern C++ code, such as #42387. It is likely that the Clang CFG also needs to be updated. Such changes in the CFG may improve quality of clang warnings outside of the Static Analyzer.

Currently, ArduPilot does not have a short and concise way to implement and test custom controllers. This project’s main aim is to create a systematic and sustainable way to implement a custom controller into ArduPilot using Simulink code generation and set an example for other researchers on how to use ArduPilot as a control system development platform. I implemented a new controller in the ArduCopter and has a Simulink model of this controller, thus I will continue with this vehicle type. But the methods laid during this project should be transferable to the other vehicle types. There are multiple-step I identified to achieve this goal. Firstly, the ArduCopter attitude controller code structure needs to be changed to allow running custom controller concurrently and safely switching between two-controller. Second, a hook in ArduCopter for Simulink code generation to bind should be created. Third, human-readable source code from Simulink without any dependencies on the Matlab libraries should be generated. Fourth, prepare a Matlab script to automatically merge generated libraries into ArduCopter source code, and configure and build it.

Faust Integration in HISE,etXzat,https://resonant-bytes.de/blog/gsoc-final-submission/,"sletz, christoph-hart",GRAME,"llvm, juce, Faust","audio, Synthesis, Musical Instruments","The proposed GSoC project aims at integrating support for the Faust audio programming language into HISE, an extensive framework for the creation of sample-based virtual musical instruments. There are multiple ways to accomplish the integration, ahead-of-time compilation and just-in-time compilation, each with their specific benefits and shortcomings. The most straight-forward method involves ahead-of-time compilation of the Faust code into a dynamic library which the HISE instrument can interface with. This works well for finished products which will be exported and compiled once, but run many times. During prototyping, however, build time is essential and relinking the complete instrument would be excessive. In that case machine code will be generated just-in-time (JIT) from the Faust source code whenever it is modified without recompiling or linking the rest of the instrument. Faust already provides the necessary mechanisms for just-in-time compilation via LLVM, which will be tied to suitable data structures inside HISE. Lastly HISE also provides an integrated development environment (IDE) with a syntax-highlighting text editor to the instrument developer. Programming the instruments in Faust should be an on-par experience to the developer when comparing to other supported languages, e.g., SNEX and JavaScript. Therefore the existing development environment will be extended to support the Faust language, while allowing the developer to still use their editors and tools outside of HISE.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/cAyIN9Bi

[pysal] Morphological Street Network Simplification,Gabriel Agostini,https://github.com/gsagostini/network-simplification,"James Gaboardi, Martin Fleischmann, Andres Morfin Veytia",NumFOCUS,python,"Graph Theory, Urban Data Science, Street Networks, Urban Morphology","The study of urban morphology relies on clever abstractions of the built environment into computationally tractable models. One such model, the street network, is a graph whose edges are streets and nodes are street intersections. Network analysis tools are often tailored for street networks with the purpose of routing. In shortest path computations, network data must carefully reflect not only urban infrastructure but also the intricacy of transportation policies–such as multiple lanes and traffic direction. From the perspective of urban morphology, these features add noise to the geometric order of cities. Perpendicular two-lane streets cross in four intersections, producing a dummy city block, for example. Street networks carefully processed to answer pressing accessibility questions are not suitable for morphological analysis. We would like to develop source-agnostic functions to process street network data for meaningful morphological analysis. The final network should be, at least, free from multiple nodes representing the same intersection and multiple edges representing the same street. This processing must rely on inherent network properties such as node connectivity and edge lengths, but not on auxiliary data such as OSM tags and building footprints. The functions will be collected under pysal’s momepy module, added to an existing toolbox of scalable urban morphological analysis.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/NIcNOOAQ

However, with the recent research on big data analysis, formats that focus on performance would greatly improve the potential to work with big genomics datasets. This project aims to be a step towards discovering the advantages of the many possible formats in many possible scenarios, by making it easy to translate any one of them to another. Such an objective seems useful for: Discovering the optimal format for performance critical applications. Easy conversion from one tool to another, for bioinformatics researchers and hackers. We will achieve that by using an Internal Representation of the different possible semantic data represented in each format, that will then allow translation from one format to another.

Adding CPDB support to existing Print Dialogs,Gaurav Guleria,https://github.com/TinyTrebuchet/gsoc22/blob/main/README.md,"Till Kamppeter, Aveek Basu, Ira McDonald",The Linux Foundation,"c/c++, gtk, qt, DNS-SD/Avahi, CUPS/IPP",printing,"Print Dialogs are one of the most used features for many people, and it is important that they stay up to date with the current print technologies (like CUPS) and be able to quickly adopt any new such upcoming technology (XYZ Cloud Printing Service). The print technology developers should also be able to fix any bugs as soon as they are found. However, since most Print Dialogs are provided natively by the GUI toolkits (and in some cases applications like LibreOffice and Chrome), this is often not the case. This is because the GUI toolkits themselves are large projects with long release cycles, and they have a lot of other similarly important things to work on. As of current, most GUI toolkits like GTK and QT connect their Print Dialogs directly with the print technologies like CUPS which creates problems for both. Any changes made by the print technologies, be it a bug fix or a new feature release often takes a long time to show up in the print dialogs upstream due to the reason mentioned before. Similarly, the print technologies need to constantly maintain backwards compatibility since they can’t release breaking changes if the Print Dialogs have not yet implemented them. Besides this, there is also a disconnect between the two sides due to the slow-release cycles. The Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB) introduced in 2017 by Till Kamppeter aims to de-couple the GUI from the print technologies. Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting (or any upcoming cloud printing projects) takes care of the CPD Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes. This way print technologies can react quickly and not be bound by the big GUI toolkits’ inertia. This project will attempt to get CPDB into print dialogs upstream for GTK, Qt and Chrome.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/E9I1qBEq

Street Network Simplification: A combined approach,Greg Maya,https://github.com/gregmaya/gsoc2022_network_simpl,"James Gaboardi, Martin Fleischmann, Andres Morfin Veytia",NumFOCUS,python,"network, spatial, Urban analysis","The project aims to fill the current gap in the creation of a baseline urban grid that allows for network analysis of the morphology of street networks. The idea of the project is to develop a set of tools within the current momepy.preprocessing module that combined with the current integration of NetworkX can output a solid, consistent and repeatable analysis of the urban form. Given that other libraries have also approached this issue (namely osmnx.simplification and citiyseer.tools.graphs), the idea is to contribute from the persisting issues of such libraries to then continue with a solution that is much more independent. Issues like multiple Points on LineStrings, snapping ends, and curving segments have already been addressed by such tools, but parallel LineStrings, and enclosed Linestrings (eg. round-abouts) still need to be resolved, to name a few. It seems that a categorization of the different topological issues (likely similar to the ones just mentioned) could create a framework from which to approach a final pipeline. However, it is proposed that early tests of different potential avenues be performed to sketch a planning route going forward (one of such tests is exemplified under the Approach section). The ideal solution is expected to be source-agnostic, but also leverage the current efforts already done by the community. Overall, the idea is to prioritize work alongside the mentors and the community to focus on increasing the short-term benefits of all PySAL/GeoPandas users (some of whom might already be familiar with some of the other corrections). As the project progresses over different iterative approaches, it is expected to incorporate more performance tests to counterbalance the feasibility of each approach as well as to build the desired autonomy of the tools to be reliant exclusively on input geometries.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/hclVxBUX

Bringing GPU programming to DFTK.jl,Guillaume Vigne,https://github.com/GVigne/GSoC2022_DFTK,"Valentin C., Michael Herbst",The Julia Language,julia,"numerical simulation, GPU Programming, Computational physics","Density functional theory (DFT) is an established method to compute the electronic structure of matter, with applications ranging from the development of catalysts to the discovery of new drugs. DFT finds an approximation of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the studied system: this approximation comes to solving coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To deal with this method of simulation, the DFTK package is being developed in Julia. To reduce runtime, we wish to develop the use of a local GPU to offload computations. However, the goal is to minimize the amount of code which needs to be adapted: having two different versions of the code existing at the same time (one for CPU and one for GPU) can be difficult to maintain in an open-source framework. This also makes the implementation of new algorithms difficult, and can deter newcomers from getting involved in the project. Since GPU algorithms for DFT already exist, the main challenge is to orchestrate the overall flow of data between CPU and GPU. We believe expanding the DFTK package will showcase the possibilities the Julia programming language offers and bring together many different communities involved in molecular simulation. I aim to produce an alternate version of code of the DFTK package using GPU framework by clearly highlighting the differences with the CPU version and keeping code changes as low as possible.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/GSUS0kxC

Biology in general, and most particularly metabolic modeling, is among those scientific fields that need such approaches the most to address their modern challenges. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a typical example of a constraint-based metabolic model (CBMM) [2]. However, flux sampling is considered a superior methodology. Python package dingo provides the Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling (MMC) algorithm to sample from the flux space of a metabolic network.

A common complication in premature birth is hypothermia (the baby cannot regulate its body temperature). Low-middle income settings limit access to neonatal incubators and radiant warmers. Thus, there arises a need to develop low-cost solutions to support premature newborns in their early and vulnerable stages of life. KMC (Kangaroo Mother Care) is a technique widely practiced to provide thermal support to newborns. During KMC, a caregiver maximizes contact with the newborn by laying the newborn, skin-to-skin on their chest. Since KMC is a highly burdening activity, the caregiver might need breaks for personal care making the baby vulnerable to a loss of a thermal source. The patented NeoWarm device is a low-cost solution to this problem. It not only augments the natural KMC session by providing extra heat but also regulates and monitors the temperature of a newborn even when the caregiver-newborn dyad is not engaged in KMC (standalone mode). The NeoRoo app provides a digital interface to the NeoWarm device by monitoring the vitals of the baby over BLE and sending alerts to responsible medical professionals and parents if the baby's vitals are found to be abnormal. It also establishes a mode of communication between the medical professionals and the guardians of the baby so that there are shared goals, coordinated tasks along with exchange of information for better neonatal care.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ye846qnn

This problem is technically difficult due to the constraints of correlation matrices (entries in [-1,1], positive semi-definiteness). The current methods can only scale to a few tens of dimensions. This project aims to provide efficient C++ implementations for new geometric-flavored algorithms to sample correlation matrices (Arakelian, Chalkis 2021) and integrate them into VolEsti, an open-source high-performance software for sampling, volume computing and geometric statistics. Our main tasks consist of implementing a new class of convex bodies to represent the space of correlation matrices and geometric operations for performing two random walk sampling algorithms (the accelerated billiard walk and Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm) over those convex bodies. These tasks can be supported by the already existing geometric facilities of VolEsti and the theoretical results found in related works. We will focus mainly on building an optimized C++ code to achieve better scalability for those algorithms and carry out intensive experiment and benchmark with other competitors to justify our efficiency. The expected duration of this project is 175 hours spread over 7 weeks of coding period (June 13 - July 29).

Tau leptons decay into hadrons and lighter leptons, these analyses require efficient tagging of tau leptons for obtaining good signal to background ratios for discovery/exclusion. There has been recent work by CMS that incorporates DNNs (Deep Neural Networks) for performing tau identification that shows encouraging results. An E2E GNN working directly on the raw collider data may be able to provide better results. The goal may be tackled in the following steps: 1. Exploration and analysis of different strategies for graph construction: This would include the node construction and edge construction, which would further include pruning, preprocessing, and input representations. 2. Developing different graph architectures: This step would firstly include exploratory testing between different GNN architectures. Then taking ideas from the exploratory analysis novel architectures can be experimented with. 3.

This project implemented a class of molecular dynamics simulations known as replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) to this library. REMD methods are very important in the study of complex biomolecules such as proteins, due to their ability to better explore the configurational space of such molecular systems by running many parallel copies of MD simulations with different conditions and sampling states from all these copies. These states are then periodically exchanged which helps in evading local minima. During the complete project phase, variants of REMD known as temperature-REMD and Hamiltonian-REMD were implemented. Along with these a general interface to define custom REMD simulations, improvements to the parallelization, more potentials and many improvements to the whole library in general were introduced.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/BK7TI3rX

This proposal aims at helping neuroscience and open-source communities by refactoring and optimizing Disimpy’s code. With this optimization, simulation runtimes and GPU memory usage could be reduced, achieving a higher precision in DW-MRI simulations, which could bring us closer to the real and complex behavior of the system that shapes brain tissue. Disimpy is a GPU-accelerated diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance simulator that is used for developing and validating neuroimaging methods. Diffusion MRI is an imaging modality that provides us with information such as the orientation, the size, or the shape of neurons from the random displacements of water molecules in brain tissue. Water molecule diffusion patterns show how the molecules interact with the environment, revealing microscopic details about tissue structure, either sane or impaired. Diffusion MRI simulations require high precision to represent reality meticulously. Hence, optimizing the code that runs the simulation seems reasonable and extremely important.

Research already focuses on improving reliability, performance of such networks and also efficiency of the underlying hardware. One promising candidate for improvements is TX-Power Control (TPC). Adjusting the transmit power per packet basically promises improvements in overall throughput in wireless networks and/or the efficiency by improved resource allocation in wireless networks. Dated back to 2007, Atheros IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n chipsets driven by ath5k and ath9k Linux drivers did first and Mediatek joined recently with hardware support for tx-power control. Those also allow access to set the tx-power per packet, but yet do not provide a driver interface for this. Unfortunately, also the mac80211 subsystem, which is responsible for WiFi communication in the Linux kernel, does not provide an appropriate API to support TPC and per-packet annotation of tx-power. The goal of this project is to implement the missing three-tier software parts: (1) mac80211 structs to annotate tx-power levels per packet, (2) mac80211 structs to account tx-power status information once transmitted and (3) a transmit power control (TPC) API for TPC algorithms.

Verible was created to handle un-preprocessed files, meaning that the parser's grammar handles the preprocessor directives in a limited way, e.g. macros are not expanded. A proper preprocessor is a must have in many cases, for example when a macro defined body doesn't add up to a non-terminal in the parser's grammar, in this case the un-preprocessed code doesn't make sense. Verible currently contains a pseudo-preprocessor tool, which have a flag option to filter out comments. A decoupled design between the lexer and parser will help us feed the lexed tokens to the preprocessor, then back to the parser.

For example, recently I implemented Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) from scratch in JAX. Readers can easily connect maths with code by referring to this kind of from-scratch implementation. Also, pure JAX code can introduce some unique features of JAX such as lax.scan() to optimize the training loop. 2) I will improve the quality of the existing figures in textbooks using a set of matplotlib configurations we use in our group for research papers. For example, In Figure 2.4 of book1, due to missing y-label, x-label, and legend, readers may find difficulty in understanding the figure. I will fill these small gaps and also improve the figure by applying latexify on them. Latexify is a function that applies latex effects by setting consistent font style, font size, and figure size with other text in the book. For example, this gist (https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/9c5c2ee77afd495759ed1a2aad0e460e) shows an improvement of the above figure. I have already started to work on this thread and contributed by improving Figure 2.2, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, and Figure 2.15 of the book1. 3) Add an Interactive demo for figures wherever applicable: I will add some interactive demos for figures so the reader can visualize the effect of variables in a particular problem. For example, figure 2.9 shows two different binomial distributions for two different θ (probability of success). I have added an interactive demo as shown in this notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/binom_dist_plot.ipynb) In above notebook readers can change θ and understand the effect of θ on the binomial distribution.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/AtU8TBJz

Traditionally, biological data are often stored as human-readable flat files or as entries in a conventional relational database. However, a drawback of such approaches is that the space required to maintain these data is becoming increasingly unmanageable, significantly reducing the scalability. Additionally, along with the size of the database, the time to query the database also increases. As stated in the problem statement, on Ensembl, homology data are currently stored as tuples in a relational database, resulting in the whole database being large and hard to scale. A natural way to compactly store the data is to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of homology relationships. We propose multiple hierarchical data structures and formatting methods to improve the space efficiency of homology databases as well as important metrics to consider when designing such data structures and formats. We propose these potential approaches with the application in actual gene homology databases in mind.

To make our DApp more flexible and user friendly, we need to add more voting algorithms apart from General Voting Algorithm. The three important features that need to be implemented are 1) Open and Invite based elections. 2) Authentication and user KYC. 3) Multiple algorithms to conduct elections. To implement these features, I would first work on the algorithms which will be written in Solidity. The front-end part will use Reactjs. For KYC verification, I'll use IPFS to store the document and encrypt the file. The admins can decrypt the file when verifying. This process of encryption, decryption and verification can be handled using Solidity. There is also an option to create open elections or invite-based. Invite-based elections can be done using EmailJS and SendGrid to send the election link to the email. Since these links can be shared, there will be a check to ensure that only the invited voter is voting. To increase user engagement, we will provide a domain `abc.voter` to get them identified as a voter for using our platform. This domain will also mint an NFT and the voter now has it. There are several other features that I would add such as ""Extend Election Dates"", ""Restrict Past Dates"", ""Logout functionality"", ""Profile Edit"", and ""Improve the UI"".",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/0OQH7BRI

The goal of the project is the full implementation of the VF2++ algorithm, which is an improved version of the original VF2 algorithm, extended to directed and multigraph settings, in a nonrecursive manner. The brief description of the original algorithm (VF2) is that, after verifying that both the input graphs have the same number of nodes and the exact same degree sequences, it starts constructing a mapping, between the nodes of the two graphs. If the mapping can be extended such that, every node from the first graph is matched to a node of the second graph, then the two graphs are considered to be Isomorphic. The imporved version (VF2++), performs a preprocess, during which, a matching order is found, such that the algorithm is able to recognize the feasibility of the examined branches, avoiding a significant amount of computations by excluding the infeasible ones. The plan to solve the problem is the following. Step 1: extensive research, questions asked and ideas discussed with the mentors. Establishment of a clear understanding of the topic is crucial. Step 2: Decomposition of the problem into smaller and more distinct, less complex sub-problems. These are basically the helper functions that are eventually going to be combined to form the final result. Step 3: Strict testing and reviewing the implementations throughout the entire process. Feedback from the community and the mentors regarding the progress so far. Step 4: Improvements based on the obtained feedback, application of optimizations, possible extra new features added. Step 5: Integration of the final algorithm into the software of NetworkX. Possibly requires the creation of a wrapper class, hosting all the created functionalities. Step 6: Discussions about further improvements out of the scope of GSoC.

However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require the setting for the hyperparameters.

The game gets harder as new asteroids spawn. Following this logic, the project's idea is to remake the original Asteroids game, with a modern design and new features, such as the multiplayer mode. It would be really nostalgic and fun to be able to play it again, especially for those who played it back in the 80's and 90's. Moreover, due to its complexity, uniqueness and system support, the project may be a part of the Liquid Galaxy demonstration, bringing more emphasis to the lab.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/W5iole2x

Proposal for Optimization of Scala Native linker,Liangyong Yu,https://github.com/yuly16/Scala-Native-GSoC-Report,Wojciech Mazur,Scala Center,"llvm, scala","optimization, compiler, jvm, Bytecode","Scala Native is an ahead-of-time and prevalent compiler for Scala. The traditional compilation is to compile Scala into Java Virtual Machine(JVM) bytecodes, which are executed by JVM. Scala Native compiles Scala into LLVM intermediate representation(LLVM IR) rather than JVM bytecodes. This property decreases the overhead of JVM and improves compilation performance. However, one of the most criticized aspects of Scala Native is its slow compilation efficiency and long build time, especially for large projects. Therefore, the optimization of Scala Native is urgently needed. The aim of this project is to build benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the Scala Native linker, and explore feasible solutions to accelerate the building task of Scala Native. Three aspects are going to be exploited: speeding up the optimizer, introducing incremental compilation, and changing the compilation and linking procedure. As a result, we expect to create benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Native Scala, and to reduce the build time by at least 20%.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/tadWDHMj

Given an initial set, modeling the uncertainty on the initial state, it aims to answer the question ""What is the set containing all possible final states?"" This question is relevant in several domains such as safety-critical applications and systems verification. Traditional approaches have mainly concentrated to convex sets, which can lead to overestimation of the final state when this is actually non-convex (so-called wrapping effect). Recently, Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes (SPZ) have been introduced as a set representation for both convex and non-convex sets. SPZ have been shown to have a compact representation that allows efficient manipulation. The goal of this project is to implement Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes in LazySets.jl and the corresponding reachability algorithms in ReachabilityAnalysis.jl for the JuliaReach organization.

While clad works in the frontend of the compilation process, Enzyme, another LLVM based AD plugin works in the backend, where it takes in code in LLVM IR form and then differentiates the code. This proposal aims to integrate Clad with Enzyme, and give the user the option of selecting Enzyme for Automatic Differentiation, based on his/her needs. This will give the user the same User Interface as clad for writing his/her code, but the option of using Enzyme as the backend with all its optimisations to calculate the Derivative/Gradient of the requested function.

Implementation of a quantum error correction code library for Julia’s Clifford gate simulator,Maria Gragera Garces,https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/pull/78,Stefan Krastanov,The Julia Language,julia,"Quantum Computing, Quantum error correction, Quantum technologies, Clifford gates, Physics simulations","The hardware necessary to build networks, sensors and computers of quantum nature is at its infancy. Potential quantum memories, repeaters, and switches are being researched all over the world, and the quantum hardware race has started. Therefore, a need for efficient, functional, and accurate open-source quantum networking modelling tools has never been more imminent. Projects such as Julia’s QuantumClifford.jl enable researchers across the globe to research various aspects of quantum networking while anticipating the creation of the necessary hardware to produce laboratory experiments. They present cheap and efficient environments to start building potential switch, protocol, and network designs. In classical computing, if one wants to protect a bit against errors, it can often suffice to represent that bit by a logical bit by repeating the data bit. Nevertheless, in a quantum setting, that type measurement is much more complex. Quantum qubit theory along with quantum noise present one of the most challenging problems that the quantum information field must overcome to become scalable and profitable: How to account for the error correction, needed due to quantum noise, in quantum gates? Simulators, such as Julia's Clifford gate simulator, must mimic not only the behaviour of quantum noise, but also the effects of currently proposed quantum error correction codes. For this reason, this project proses a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes for Julia’s simulator of Quantum Clifford Circuits. These would include the Steane, Shor, and Toric codes, as well as other Surface and CSS quantum error correction codes.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/kpQWzjgc

Forward edge attacks (through function pointers and virtual calls) were proven to be less accessible after implementing Control-flow integrity (CFI) solutions. However, backward edge attacks easily bypass present instrumentation (Safe Stacks, canaries). Under these circumstances, shadow stacks become more than necessary: shadow stacks are a defense mechanism that require metadata about the program’s state to enforce their policies. They protect the return value of the functions by comparing what’s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage.

The open-source parameter fitting software Neuroptimus (formerly Optimizer) was developed to enable the straightforward application of advanced parameter optimization methods (such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms including PCs and supercomputers. Neuroptimus currently uses various built-in cost functions and those implemented by the eFEL feature extraction library to compare the behavior of the models to the (experimental) target data. However, this approach severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by the optimization. On the other hand, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors. The aim of the current project is to extend the open-source neural parameter optimization tool Neuroptimus so that it is able to use test scores from the SciUnit framework as the cost function during optimization. Direct applications would include the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons using a combination of Neuroptimus and HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit. Deliverables: 1. Implement changes in the Neuroptimus core so that it is able to use SciUnit test scores as cost functions during optimization 2. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that arbitrary combinations of built-in cost functions, eFEL features, and SciUnit test scores can be used 3. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that the new features become accessible from the graphical user interface 4.

It’s the foundation of the openBIM workflow. Today, IFC is most often used as a software-agnostic way of exchanging building information, but there is increasing interest in using the IFC schema as the native format for working with BIM data. Blender, with its mature modelling and rendering capabilities, has the potential to become a powerful BIM authoring tool. Open data and integrated python console already give many options for customising the data and meta data of any geometric object. The BlenderBIM plugin introduces the possibility to assign the properties of IFC classes to native blender geometry and export correctly structured IFC files through the use of the IfcOpenShell software library that already contains many useful functions to work with the IFC schema. The goal of this project is to develop a plugin for the visual scripting language for Blender, Sverchok, that would enable creating IFC geometry and data through the visual programming nodes, allowing the users to create their own parametric workflows and incorporate IFC data directly into their design process. An equivalent plugin for Sverchok, would allow an integrated parametric design and native IFC workflow to be completed fully inside the FOSS environment. It would also be a strong foundation for integrations with other Building Performance Simulations (BPS) tools. Integration and porting of the nodes to FreeCAD would also be possible. Some of the basic nodes are already coded under the IfcSverchok project. The work will involve testing the existing nodes and writing many more to support the full use case.

Expanding FEniCSx electromagnetic demos,Michele Castriotta,https://mikics.github.io/gsoc-jupyterbook/submission.html,"Igor Baratta, Jørgen Dokken, Jack S. Hale",NumFOCUS,"python, c++","Photonics, Electromagnetism, Finite Element Method, FEniCSx, PDE","Electromagnetic devices have become ubiquitous in our lives due to their limitless applications. For designing and optimizing such devices, non-uniform and unstructured meshes are essential, due to the multiscale nature of the problem. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is well known for handling such meshes. FEniCSx is an open-source platform for solving partial differential equations with the FEM, offering high-level Python and C++ interfaces. It has become a popular choice among FEM users, especially for solid mechanic and fluid dynamic applications. However, FEniCSx has not met the same popularity for electromagnetic applications due to the lack of comprehensive demos showing how to correctly setup and solve electromagnetic partial differential equations, and therefore many researchers and engineers in this field prefer to use other (often commercial) FEM platforms. This proposal aims to solve this issue by developing extensive and accessible electromagnetic demos for a number of case studies. In particular, the work will focus on delivering at least five demos (plus tests and documentation), regarding 1) the use of complex numbers, the implementation of 2) Scattering Boundary Conditions, 3) Perfectly Matched Layers, and 4) Maxwell's equations for axisymmetric structures, and 5) the parallelization of a parameterized problem with the MPI COMM_SELF communicator. These additions will be a step towards the extensive use of FEniCSx in the electromagnetic community since they will provide working tools for real-world problems. The demos will also be a show-reel for new features of FEniCSx that have not been covered in past demos or tutorials. A long term effect of this work could be more developers involved in the FEniCSx project, more guiding feedback from end users, and promotion of open source software for electromagnetic/photonic simulations.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ezCgCetb

Bayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) in Stingray,Mihir Tripathi,https://mihirtripathi97.github.io/GSoC-22/,"Matteo Bachetti, dhuppenkothen",OpenAstronomy,python,"astronomy, Bayesian Statistics, X-Ray Astronomy","Stingray is a python package that provides a common platform for time series analysis of X-ray data to the astronomy community. One important aspect of time series analysis of astronomical sources is to identify and characterize their variability from their light curves. The light curves of these sources are affected by spurious variability from variable backgrounds and gaps due to occultation or inaccessibility of the source. This causes data to be affected by Poissonian uncertainties. In the case of sources that are near to detection limit of telescope, these uncertainties are dominant. Bayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) is a statistical method to measure variability in Poisson-distributed data. The method has been developed to analyze X-Ray light curves of faint sources observed by eROSITA telescope. Bexvar is a Bayesian formulation of the excess variance method. The aim of this project is to implement this method in Stingray, create test cases for the method based on real observational data and write appropriate documentation.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/rG1XqJqK

It enables users to integrate Fortran code into Python easily and quickly. F2PY has been in maintenance mode since 2009, ever since it became feature-complete for Fortran 77. Beginners browsing its codebase in the current state might find it challenging to read, understand and contribute. The frontend of F2PY is a handwritten command line parser that predates the intrinsic ‘argparse’ module by several years. This project will include modernising the CLI with the “argparse” python library, simplifying the frontend codebase and making it more developer-friendly to contribute to. Since “np.distutils” is set for deprecation, I propose adding an option to build the F2PY’s generated CPython extension modules with Meson. Meson will significantly speed up building standalone extension modules through the F2PY CLI. There is no change proposed to the process of generating C and Fortran wrappers from Fortran source files. Generation of the source code for integration in Python projects will be carried out in the same way. Currently, “np.distutils” is used by F2PY to build generated extension modules. Adding a Meson backend will provide faster builds and long-term backend support for F2PY. Additionally, I plan to re-implement the class-based test-suite of F2PY in a modern pytest manner and add a developer’s guide to F2PY.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/w3AXQo5h

KubeArmor provides a policy based system to increase the quality of security in a Kubernetes cluster. Users need to define their own policy when implementing KubeArmor. Most users might find it challenging to define the most appropriate and effective security policy based on their use case. Currently there are limited ways for users to actually get observability data that can be used to assist them and provide better reasoning when creating an optimal security policy. The solution to this problem is by providing visibility telemetry events to show pod or container observability data. Observability data can consist of processes executions, file system accesses, and network accesses. This information is expected to assist users to create an optimal security policy. This solution is implemented by developing and deploying a Kubernetes service that will connect to the KubeArmor relay and get the events from the daemonsets. These events will then be aggregated and stored in the database for future use. Users can get the data by using the KubeArmor CLI program which will be extended to accommodate this solution.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/rmHL0Mcl

Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are bio-inspired imaging sensors that work differently to traditional cameras in that they measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of capturing images at a fixed rate. Since the way event cameras capture data is fundamentally different to traditional cameras, novel methods are required to process the output of these sensors. In addition to dealing with ways for capturing data with event cameras, event-based vision encompasses techniques to process the captured data - events - as well, including learning-based techniques and models, spiking neural networks (SNNs) being an example. This project aims to create benchmark datasets for object recognition tasks with event-based cameras. Using machine learning solutions for such tasks requires a sufficiently large and varied collection of data.

However, these computations were largely limited to the study level - how frequently a scanner idled between studies and how long it took for a scanner to perform a given study. Computing those metrics in a finger granularity, at the series level, is more challenging since the start time and end time of a series is harder to find with just public DICOM headers.

If policies data grows, however, the growing cost of main memory resources and bad performance make the memory management strategy not tolerable anymore. We need to find a better way to manage the casbin in-memory data when data grows. From my point of view, our main goal is to reduce the cost of memory as well as keep good performance handling policies read and write requests. In order to achieve those key goals, we can introduce an experimental tuple storage to get charge of storing those policies, turning the policies management strategy from memory-oriented to disk-oriented. We can even make a better abstraction of the storage layer so that we can use different engines (row, column) for the different workloads. In general, we can take the following parts into consideration to achieve our goals. 1. API for upper layer. 2. workload optimizer. 3. Buffer Pool management. 4. Indexing. 5. Data Storage Structures. 6. Transaction if necessary. And in the end, the deliverables will be : A Casbin built-in embedded disk-oriented tuple storage engine. The Engine should contain ： 1.

Extend Z compressed graphic format support,Oplopoios Paris,https://offtkp.github.io/GSoC22FE/,Tomaž Vajngerl,LibreOffice,c++,"compression, Format support, uncompression","Currently, there is uncompression support for .svgz format, which is a Z compressed .svg file. The goal of this project is to extend support for Z compressed graphic formats, namely .wmz and .emz, which currently can't be opened by LibreOffice. The second goal of this project is to implement saving functionality for .svgz, .wmz and .emz. While .svgz is an option in the save dialog, it is incorrectly implemented (no compression actually happens, it's just an svg with a different extension). The plan is to create a new and extensible way that uncompresses the file buffer after determining if its compressed from its header,and try to open the uncompressed file buffer. The plan for the second goal would be to find a way to determine whether the file we're saving needs to be compressed (either by checking the extension or by creating a new option in the file saving dialog) and compress the file buffer before saving. This is not as easy as it sounds, as we need to factor in various pitfalls such as what happens when there's not enough RAM to hold the temporary compressed buffer for example. Deliverables would be an extensible way to load and save Z compressed files, an exhaustive unit test suite, which will test file detection, graphic loading, pitfall handling behavior and ready made test files.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/9YaaPO77

Since the conception of cheaper alternatives like MUSE, OpenBCI, etc - there have been an influx of consumer grade EEGs that allow the general public to have access to such devices. However, there is a lack of a standard and easy to use library to conduct and reproduce research on these devices. EEG - Notebooks provides the necessary software required to pull together the various enabling technologies necessary for running these experiments and analyzing the data. This can open dramatic new possibilities for both neurotech and cognitive neuroscience education, as well as more ambitious and large-scale research and clinical applications using large numbers of devices and or more naturalistic (out-of lab) settings. This leads towards the larger goal of contributing to the democratization of the cognitive neuroscience experimental world. In its current state, the source code for the EEG-Notebooks experiment library is limited by its overly repeated and non-generalized code. This project seeks to tackle that issue by using classes and Inheritance to make the code easier to read, more extendable to the open source community, and a better experience for the general user.

Automatic system images based on a specific user workflow,Petr Vana,https://github.com/petvana/AutoSysimages.jl,,The Julia Language,julia,"System images, Precompilation, Build infrastructure","Time to First Plot (TTFP) is one of the most disliked things about Julia language because it takes from seconds to minutes to produce the first output. This is caused by the underlying Just-In-Time compilation, and the current solution is to build a user system image containing pre-loaded libraries with precompiled code. However, the workflow is primarily manual, and users are forced to recompile the system image after any package update. Currently, Julia's developers work on introducing system-image-like blobs containing compiled native code for a specific package. However, both these methods compile only package-specific precompile statements by default, and the project will introduce a new package to change this paradigm. The package would collect precompile statements during normal usage of Julia and offer to recompile the system image (or blobs) once the libraries are updated.

Evaluation, mockups, code-complete implementation, testing, and documentation of the individual elements such as labels, links, and images as well as composite components such as headers, footers and pagination will be performed. The project ensures creating a consistent framework with an exhaustive three-step workflow: 1. Inventory/Evaluation Phase: Variations in individual elements and composite components from each website are recorded to ensure all alternates are captured. 2. Iterative Design Phase: Mockups are created for each evaluated component considering all the possible variations encountered during evaluation. The mockups will be subsequently iterated upon after review and deliberation with the Design Team and other project stakeholders. 3. Implementation and Testing Phase: The final approved mockup will be implemented in TailwindCSS. The element/component will be documented and tested. Once the implementation is approved and all tests pass the element/component will be incorporated into the framework.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/yJTqNMbb

It uses Hyper Parameter Optimization to tune the language runtime layers of a given application. System component metrics can give a better look into what is happening inside them. Metrics are particularly useful for building dashboards and alerts. Kubernetes components emit metrics in Prometheus format. This format is structured plain text, designed so that people and machines can both read it.Following are four common methods of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning in order of increasing efficiency: 1.Manual 2.Grid search 3.Random search 4.Bayesian model-based optimization The aim of Bayesian reasoning is to become “less wrong” with more data which these approaches do by continually updating the surrogate probability model after each evaluation of the objective function. At a high-level, Bayesian optimization methods are efficient because they choose the next hyperparameters in an informed manner. The basic idea is: spend a little more time selecting the next hyperparameters in order to make fewer calls to the objective function. In practice, the time spent selecting the next hyperparameters is inconsequential compared to the time spent in the objective function. By evaluating hyperparameters that appear more promising from past results, Bayesian methods can find better model settings than random search in fewer iterations.So,this project aims at tuning kubernetes applications using bayesian optimization.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/G5B72NfB

Its main purpose is to provide an easy and convenient way to organize learning resources and build channels for Kolibri. User Experience is a really important aspect of Kolibri Studio as it may involve multiple users working on the same content curation unit (channels). Delayed reflection of the modified state of a channel to a collaborative user may cause inconvenience and may even lead to repetitive change to the same entity. The current setup for Real-Time Communication in Studio involves maintaining a server-side log which is being simulated by calling the POST method of sync API. All collaborative users are hitting this POST method at regular intervals to post any changes made by them (if no changes are made then the empty changes array is posted) and receive any changes made by other users as a response of this method. The proposed WebSocket architecture will neutralize and reduce the load on the server which is currently being created due to continuous polling of the APIs. It will convert the complex underlying structure of Sync API into a simple real-time-friendly architecture in which a full-duplex communication between client and server takes place. It will also enormously enhance the user experience of the whole process of collaborative content curation.,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/AsVsGFCq

It is often time-consuming to figure out the root cause of such issues, and most importantly not all alerts and issues are important and do not need human interaction.

The brain imaging data structure format is a widely-adopted framework for disseminating clean datasets for use in the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analyses (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This project would aid in this pursuit by establishing built-in support for the BIDS format within the Pydra software package. Pydra is a library that allows complete control of the command line through Python (e.g., within a Jupyter Notebook). The majority of brain imaging data is analyzed using many commands that operate in a serial manner for cleaning, aligning, and applying statistical models to the data often in batches. Rather than relying on shell scripting and manual documentation of software versions, commands used, and outputs that are generated, Pydra can do so automatically. Pydra not only allows commands to be run through Python that would normally be run within the command line, but also unlocks the ability to interface with any CLI binaries a user might have installed as third party tools. Beyond this, Pydra allows the development of ‘workflows’ or stepwise processing pipelines with traceable software and command provenance, allowing an individual to essentially run an exact analysis in a “frozen” environment that the original publisher/researcher/scientist used themselves.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/U46zNrr6

Adding SMP synchronization,Sairaj Kodilkar,https://unikraft.org/blog/2022-06-27-unikraft-synchronization/,"Cristian Vijelie, Marc Rittinghaus",Unikraft,"c language, operating systems",Synchronization,"At the moment, Unikraft can leverage a single processor only. While there can be multiple threads (i.e., multiprogramming), no two activities actually run at the same time (i.e., multiprocessing). Unikraft introduces support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), thereby allowing it to execute code on all processors and cores of a system concurrently. This creates new challenges for synchronizing access to shared resources. On a single-processor machine synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores can consider interrupts as the only source of parallel execution. It is thus sufficient to protect a critical section of code by temporarily disabling interrupts. With SMP, however, this is no longer sufficient as other processors may access shared resources at any time. The project will involve studying locking mechanisms used in modern kernels like Linux, FreeBSD, etc, improving the existing locking mechanisms in unikraft, and implementing new mechanisms such as read-write. The important part of the project will be identifying the critical sections present in the kernel and protecting these critical sections.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/K2BWctCe

Currently they must add a flag to specify the old pass manager. In this project I will integrate the new pass manager in the enzyme code thus making Enzyme callable by the new pass manager.

To deliver better search results, web crawlers need to have a context of the data and to understand the data better, structured data is used. Structured data is the data which conforms to a data model, has a well defined structure, follows a consistent order and can be easily accessed and used by a person or a computer program. It is used by search engines to generate rich snippets, which are small pieces of information that will then appear in search results making the search results more relevant. Currently Joomla! has rich snippets implemented but it uses inline microdata to implement rich snippets which is difficult to modify from the backend as it is hard coded into the html. With this project I’ll be working on to making it easier for the user to dynamically integrate structured data from the backend. For the dynamic integration of structured data I’ll be using schema.org which provides a universally recognized format for structuring data on the Web. There are different ways to implement schema markup but for this project I’ll be using JSON-LD as it can be inserted into the web page without disrupting other contents or HTML and it is easy to store in the database. This project will help user to add, update or delete schema markup on the articles from the backend.

Besides these, supporting 1st CLaaS on Local FPGAs/Remote FPGAs contrary to AWS F1 would prove useful to enthusiasts, researchers, professors and students having FPGA on-premise or remotely accessible. 1st CLaaS for PYNQ leverages the PYNQ (Python Productivity for Zynq) Framework, which consists of a Jupyter Server running in a Linux Operating system on the ARM Processor in the Zynq SoC. Addressing the current limitations of 1st CLaaS, the proposed framework that not only brings 1st CLaaS to PYNQ FPGAs, but also vendor agnostically automates TL-Verilog/Verilog/SystemVerilog based Hardware accelerator design from RTL to bitstream and deployment eliminating the need to interact with a wide range of vendor specific tools. The framework would provide a complete FPGA based hardware design flow within the browser/terminal right from designing in makerchip-app and IP-Block design-Bitstream generation to deployment on FPGA in a single command.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/9LIcUGoQ

Currently, the package only supports four regression models (Linear, Logistic, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression). There is a huge scope of adding many more models to the package. To start with, we can add the Gamma and Inverse Gaussian regression models, and the ARIMA model for time series. Over time, more models can be added to the package. There is also a scope of adding new macros to the package to make the syntax more clean. An example of this is in the fitmodel function of the package (and is explained via a code snippet in the proposal). From the documentation, it can also be seen that any model has many attributes which are computed when the fit function is called. When working on big data, it is possible that not all the attribute values are needed, so it is currently inefficient to compute every attribute. Instead, one can compute the attributes lazily, i.e as and when they are needed. Rigorous unit testing should be added to the package to ensure code correctness. Also, the package code can use a lot of help with its documentation and code coverage. All of these can be implemented using CI/CD. Finally, in its current state, the package lacks strict code conventions (like variable names, commit message rules etc). These are essential to ensure good quality code and to make the job easier for future contributors. To enforce this, linting can be added to the code along with Git hooks to enforce these conventions. Also, a well defined API should be documented for the models, so that new models can be added at ease.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/wbPGeN3c

This behaviour is pretty much the same as when you try to manage your files on your Operating System, and you can drag a rectangle to select multiple files, then moving them around, copying, deleting. The design is that the Blocks multi-select feature will be only functional when you hold the Shift key, so that users can still drag the workspace when not. Users can simply click on the blocks to select or unselect them, or drag a rectangle to select a set of them at the same time. A button would also be added to enable multi-selection feature in case users are unable to access the keyboard. It sounds like a little bit easy, but actually, I would say that it's not. Multiple selections can become a crazy-complex feature when you start thinking about the details. When dragging two blocks, you have to think about how the connections will work. When you right-click on multiple selections, you also have to make sure that those options apply to all blocks. And the touch screen problem would also need to be addressed.

The program will be able to convert the atomic coordinates and charge of an organic molecule presented as an xyz file to an RDKit molecule object. Once the tool is equipped, RDKit users will have another way to construct a molecule. The core work of the project will involve working on reimplementation of the Python programs function's. The main two steps of the program are 1) deriving atomic connectivities from coordinates and 2) determining the most favorable bond ordering from atomic connectivities. Atomic connectivities are found using either the Huckel method or through consideration of van der Waals radii. Favorable bond ordering is determined by considering different possible valences. The project is hence split up into these subparts. Bond ordering, atomic connectivity, formal charges, and the molecule’s conformation, among a few other factors, are combined to create an RDKit mol object.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ugO4HoEX

Implementing multi-task CV models in OpenCV,star,https://github.com/obtx/opencv_zoo/tree/new-branch/models/multitask_centernet,FYtao,OpenCV,"python, c++","machine learning, computer vision","Deep learning is now used to solve many different CV problems. A typical approach is to train a separate network for each specific task. However, there is a need for models that are closer to the human brain and can solve multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a branch of machine learning, in which multiple tasks learn simultaneously through a shared model. It has the following advantages: improving data efficiency, reducing overfitting through shared representation, and using auxiliary information to learn quickly. The project has four objectives: 1. One or more multi-task CV models trained (or borrowed, if the license is appropriate), and submitted to OpenCV model zoo. Specifically, at least MCN or networks with similar functions should be successfully transplanted or improved for OpenCV, and the accuracy and less computation should be provided, which is not lower than that of the existing single OpenCV model. 2. quantize the model on the condition that the accuracy does not decrease too much. At least try to quantize the model and make a trade-off between performance and effectiveness at the end. 3. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided multi-task models. Ideally, there should be an API introduced to optionally disable some parts of the multi-task CV model and save time by not computing unnecessary parts/heads of the model. 4. Using at least one example will demonstrate how to use this multi-task model.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/XkJwt5qM

They access these permissions through Portals (in Flatpak's case) and Interfaces (in Snap's case). Discover is KDE's application for installing software. Presently, Discover can show what permissions are necessary by Snaps and Flatpaks, but lacks a mechanism to change Flatpak's permissions. Flatpaks can access buses, but it is unclear what these buses do, to users. Snaps do offer a mechanism for changing these permissions within Discover's interface (through a popup), but this has 2 problems: first, the permissions will not be understandable to most users; second, the method of displaying these permissions is inconsistent with how it is done for Flatpaks. The project's goal is to implement a mechanism to alter these permissions and their extents in a system settings module for each application, and show Snap permissions in a more informative, easier-to-digest way on Discover's interface, like for Flatpaks. PLAN TO IMPLEMENT: The project is broken into 2 stages: the first is implementation of the feature that allows tweaking of Flatpak's application. This should be done by the end of Week 7. The second is the feature to display Snaps permissions more informatively on Discover's interface, like it is done for Flatpaks. This stage will take up the remainder of the weeks. DELIVERABLES: 1. mechanism to alter Flatpak permissions through a System Settings module for each application 2. mechanism to alter Snaps' permissions through a System Settings module, for each application 3. displaying Snap permissions with additional information such as brief descriptions and icons in their application pages 4. implementation of an ""internal dictionary"" to explain what access level to each bus on the system implies to the user",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/TPLloS04

Second, creating a Front End for Fetching Data (FE Read): To create a UI for selecting which data is to be fetched. Hence using a GraphQL Server, user only needs to make a single API call, and with a better UI, user wont have to worry about writing queries for fetching data. Deliverables : 1. Basic Fetching of documents (single and multiple documents of an elasticsearch index) 2. Implementing Dataloader in the GraphQL server for decreasing DB hits 3.

Thanks to this capability, a robot is able to automatically adapt to changes during its operation. In the case of autonomous navigation, if the robot is endowed with this skill, it can automatically adjust a set of free parameters to improve its functioning given a cost function or metric. The effect of this adaptation is safer, more efficient, and, possibly, better socially aware navigation. The aim of this project would be to design and implement a sliding variable based adaptive controller that can self-adapt under varying circumstances. Through this the robot would be able to successfully navigate and self adapt under social constraints as well if required.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/dWqGmh50

When a user is searching for a specific place, Nominatim returns multiple results that are likely to be what the user is looking for. These search results are ranked based on their importance values that are being derived from looking at the popularity of the locations’ Wikipedia articles. However, not every place on Earth has its own Wikipedia article. As a result, each of the places that do not have their own Wikipedia articles does not have an assigned importance value to be used to rank them correctly among the other locations in the search result. OSM publishes aggregate map access numbers that are generated based on the users’ behavior when using the map. These access numbers are a good indicator of how popular a place is. The aim of this project is to integrate the map access numbers into Nominatim to compute an importance value for all places regardless of whether they have their own Wikipedia article or not. In order to fulfill the aim of this project, a set of deliverables needs to be defined and accomplished. These are: 1) Finding the most suitable method of importing GeoTIFF files 2) Developing the import functionality 3) Investigating and developing the importance value computation algorithm based on the map access numbers 4) Writing unit tests 5) Documenting the new changes",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/EllLnlI3

Therefore, it is important to structure statistical software libraries in a natural way that reflects how users most commonly think about their problems. At present, many of the user-facing interfaces of the Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) follow inconsistent design patterns and may not be the most natural structures in terms of ease of use. This 350-hour project will study consider a set of interface designs for standardized use across the library’s statistical modeling packages and implement one such design in a development version of the library. If time permits, another aspect of this project that may be tackled is the extension of R-style Wilkinson formulas to spatial models via a Python package such as patsy or formulaic (Wilkinson and Rogers, 1973).",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/NjFg0H2U

Currently, Robolectric uses BouncyCastle as the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) security provider. Starting in Android P, Android switched to using Google Conscrypt as the security provider. To be more consistent with Android, Robolectric should update the default security provider to Conscrypt. As it is using the BouncyCastle, this means that whenever the JCA APIs are used in a Robolecetric test, BouncyCastle will be used by default. Officially, In Android the default JCE provider is Conscrypt. This is a Java wrapper over BoringSSL. The goal is to have Robolectric switch from BouncyCastle by default to Conscrypt. The Conscrypt module uses BoringSSL, a native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL and which is used in many Google products like Google Chrome for cryptography and TLS. Conscrypt uses Java code and a native library to provide the Android TLS implementation as well as a large portion of Android cryptographic functionality such as key generators, ciphers, and message digests. Conscrypt is relatively selective and focuses on the most important and widely-used algorithms. Conscrypt also supports the curves in Elliptic Curves crypto operations and it is much faster than BouncyCastle as it is optimized native code. But BoringSSL doesn't have official releases and makes no guarantees around API or ABI stability.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/EzEicWoN

It supports any kind of data stream: it has been used with multichannel audio, video frames, 3D models, OSC messages, and various others types of data. Shmdata is server-less, but requires applications to link data streams using socket path (e.g. ""/tmp/my-shmdata-stream""). Shmdata is very fast and allows processes to access data streams without the need for extra copies. However, permissions are not supported, and any stream shared on the system with Shmdata is accessible system-wide. The project will enable the possibility for a Shmdata user to configure streams permission using shared memory right setting at the API level. When sharing data between processes via shared memory, not all components of the data need to be visible to everyone. Different groups might need to access different data, furthermore, some data might only be needed to be visible to the owner of the files. In such cases, the permissions that would have to be implemented are combinations of 'read', 'write' and 'execute' permissions that would be given to the owner, group or common user(i.e. everyone else). Permissions would be 'none', 'execute only', 'write only', 'write and execute', 'read only', 'read and execute', 'read and write', 'read, write and execute' with corresponding values of 0-7 respectively.

Currently, it has ""File ID"" or FID to ""entry"" or name lookup functionality, AKA, reverse lookup and also normal lookup, which is “name” for a given FID [afs_dir_Lookup and afs_dir_InverseLookup]. afs_dir_InverseLookup is currently computationally expensive because the algorithm scans a hash index data structure embedded within a ""Directory object"" [src/dir/dir.h] looking for a name that matches the given FID. It is not performant as it's merely brute-forcing the search.[src/dir/dir.c] [Solution] Maintain a separate hash table to store reverse lookup information with key: FID and value: name, the opposite of the existing hash table within in the Directory object. I would create this hash table within the Directory object again because it could avoid the penalty of maintaining a global data structure where all the information could be stored, and would also avoid the unnecessary loading of information of the entire volume, if only one file is looked up. Global table for all directories could also perhaps not scale to really large volumes. A ""lazy"" allocation of this table, that is, fill it in only when the first request is made per Directory Object for a ""reverse"" lookup would be efficient. [Deliverables] 1. Code - Update the existing data structures [DirHeader], hereby referred to as DS. - Change the afs_dir_InverseLookup code to use the new DS - Lazy load* the information into the DS when the first request is made to “reverse” lookup. - Update the code* wherever directory updates are present (like adding and deleting a file inside the directory) * Ensure the synchronization primitives are correctly used 2. Tests - Correctness tests: check if the written code is working as expected.

Refactoring of erddapy into separate core and object layers,Vini Salazar,https://gist.github.com/vinisalazar/c2a5fc91667bf84ad7ac1ea49c553b61,"Filipe Fernandes, Mathew Biddle, Alex Kerney, Callum Rollo",IOOS,"python, ERDDAP","web, Oceanography, Environmental data","The erddapy package provides a Python interface to the ERDDAP data server API. Currently, most of erddapy's functionality is concentrated into a single class, and the URL building features are implemented in that class along with the data transformation methods that process server responses into Python objects, such as Pandas DataFrames. This project proposes to separate erddapy into core and object (or opinionated) layers. The former will hold the URL building and data transformation functionality, which will be reused by the rest of the library. The latter layer will provide high-level objects that will support a functional API that does not depend on the state of the underlying object (which is the case for the current version of erddapy). This functional API will provide cleaner iterative usage when querying multiple servers and datasets, and new classes implemented in the object layer will support serialization so that they can be pickled and passed on to other processes or machines. To execute this project, I delineate two separate aims: refactoring the URL building and data transformation functionality into a new module containing minimal, standalone functions and reusing those functions in the existing primary class; and implementing an additional layer containing the high-level objects that will provide the basis for the functional API.

We segregate the KML data into the various tracks to get a more neat visualisation of the different Map data, such as Lava flow, Historic flow, Earthquake Magnitude, Detected events, Located events, Affected areas, etc. Then we write the code to send KML data from our Flutter app to the Liquid Galaxy to visualise this data on the Liquid Galaxy rig. We store all the web scraped data in the assets so web scraping is no longer needed once data of all tracks is gathered. Also, for a user-friendly interaction experience, the movements we do on the Google Maps is detected and Google Earth of the Liquid Galaxy can be moved.

As mentioned on the project description page, VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER is a feature that devices and drivers can negotiate when the device uses descriptors in the same order in which they were made available by the driver. This feature can help devices and drivers batch buffers and improve performance. Currently the devices and drivers available in Linux and QEMU do not support the VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER feature. The only implementation is available in DPDK for the virtio-net driver. I will spend this summer to implement VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER feature in both Linux and QEMU, and in both split and packed virtqueue layouts.

After the project, we can use json function with Columnstore in Select Handler mode. We can design and implement JSON functions. My implementation idea is as follows(take the JSON_VALID function as example): ● Related files and classes: define the relevant files required by the JSON_VALID function according to the specification of the SQL function definition in Columnstore 1. functor_json.cpp: According to the return value of the function, create new class Func_json_valid derived from class Func_bool. 2. func_json_valid.cpp: the JSON_VALID function is implemented here. Implement any other methods that behave differently from the default. 3. funcexp.{h,cpp}: in FuncExp::FuncExp(), add a new entry fFuncMap[""json_valid""] = new Func_json_valid(). 4. CMakeLists.txt: Add any source files to build. ● Borrow and translate: 1. JSON_* functions are already implemented in MariaDB leveraging its own JSON format parser 2. The parser itself is couple files only library. Here is the main file. 3. So the next step is to read/understand this implementation and translate the code into Columnstore using the mentioned JSON format parser.",https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/VIJfR79a
